      <h1>Hi, I’m Sai.</h1>

      <p>
        I’m an operations builder and writer. I work at an AI startup, scaling
        operations across product, sales, and customer success. I have 5+ years
        of experience in account management and operations, with a background in
        analytics.
      </p>

      <p>I created SaiShare to share my thoughts on work, technology, art, and culture.</p>
