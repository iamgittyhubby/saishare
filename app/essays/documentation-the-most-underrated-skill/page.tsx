            <p className="text-copy p-lee">
                One of the reasons teams are inefficient is because people are unclear
                about what to do. Documentation fixes that. When you write down the
                steps, you cut out guesswork, errors, and bottlenecks. You also spot gaps
                you never noticed before. Missing steps, unnecessary steps, and steps
                only one person knows. Onboarding becomes easier because new members
                start with clarity. Off-boarding becomes smoother because knowledge
                doesn’t disappear when people leave.

            <p className="text-copy p-lee">
                So when do you document? My rule is: if I repeat something twice, I
                document it. How you document will depend on your audience and the type
                of work. But every good piece of documentation needs three things:
            </p>

            <p className="text-copy p-lee">
                <strong>Clarity:</strong> Make it easy for the intended reader to follow.
                <br />
                <strong>Flexibility:</strong> Keep it simple to update when things change.
                <br />
                <strong>Accessibility:</strong> People can easily find it when they need it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-copy p-lee">
                Bad documentation is written just to check a box. It ignores the reader,
                creates confusion, and doesn’t help anyone.
            </p>

            <p className="text-copy p-lee">
                So who should create it? The person closest to the work should write the
                first draft. They know the steps, the context, and the details that
                matter. After that, the rest of the team should review and refine it.
                People care more when they helped shape it. That ownership makes the
                documentation stronger and more accurate.
            </p>

            <p className="text-copy p-lee">
                To be clear, you don’t need a title to document. If your team has a
                process and no documentation for it, you create it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-copy p-lee">
                Documentation isn’t extra work. It is the work. Teams grow only when
                people are clear on what to do and aligned on how to do it. A process
                that isn’t documented doesn’t exist. And if it doesn’t exist, you can’t
                improve it.
            </p>

            <p className="text-copy p-lee">
                The tools and format you use for documentation will depend on your
                audience and the type of work. But here are three tools I use often:
