      <h1>AI Usage</h1>
      <p>More people are using AI than they are willing to admit.</p>
      <p>Because admitting to using AI opens them up to judgment and shame.</p>
      <p>As a result, they stay silent. But that silence has a cost.</p>
      <p>
        When people cannot speak honestly about how they use AI, we cannot learn
        what helps, what harms, or where to draw the line.
